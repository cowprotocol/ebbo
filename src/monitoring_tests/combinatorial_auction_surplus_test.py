    This test implements a logic for a combinatorial auction and compares the result to what
    actually happened.

    The combinatorial auction goes as follows:
    - Aggregate surplus on the different directed sell token-buy token pairs for all solutions in
      the competition.
    - Compute a baseline for surplus on all token pairs from those solutions.
    - Filter solutions which do not provide at least as much surplus as the baseline on all token
      pairs that the solution contains.
    - Choose one batch winner and multiple single order winners.

    The test logs an output whenever
    - the winner of the solver competition would have been filtered out in a combinatorial auction
      or
    - the total surplus in a combinatorial auction would have been significantly larger than it was
