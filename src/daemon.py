"""
At runtime, "main" function records the most recent block and initializes it as the start block.
After the daemon is asleep for 30 mins, it gets the newest block as the end block.
Since the competition endpoint has a lag of 30 mins (worst case), we wait 30 mins before we
fetch comp. data and start checking for potential surplus.
If the data was not retrievable for any reason, it adds it to the list of unchecked hashes
to be checked in the next cycle. Once all hashes in the current cycle have been iterated through,
the previous end block + 1 becomes the start block for the next cycle, and the latest block is 
the new end block. Daemon sleeps for 30 mins and continues checking.
